11/12/2025, 13:47 - ÷×: UCAL bulk order  Dolev Tenenboim
Hi Made In Market Team,
I’m following up here since I haven't received a reply to my email from Dec 9th and I want to get this resolved quickly.
To summarize our last email exchange:
You informed me that UCAL is discontinued and offered Parmalat as a replacement.
I am willing to accept the Parmalat replacement only if you can confirm it meets these 3 specific conditions:
Is it 0.5% fat or lower?
Is it Lactose-free?
Are the price and subscription terms exactly the same?
If the answer is YES to all three, please proceed with the order/subscription. If there are any differences, please let me know.

13/01/2026, 18:44 - ÷×: I need you to continue with this order asap, as further delays will be extremely problematic and insulting to my patience

15/01/2026, 14:23 - ÷×: Please refund my last payment
16/01/2026, 13:21 - ÷×: Hello MadeinMarketSupport,
I am writing this to hopefully resolve the shipping fee issue on my current order of 246 Liters without further friction. After our multiple discussions, I feel it is important to lay out why the current demands are fundamentally unfair and why I am requiring a restoration of my original terms.
Regarding this order, there are key factors that I need you to consider:

1.  *ACCOUNT HISTORY & PRECEDENT:* My purchase history shows that my weekly 70L recurring orders were delayed multiple times, which your system subsequently consolidated into a single 180L shipment. This proves that fulfilling large orders under my free shipping terms is a standard procedure that your logistics team has handled before. The transition to this 246L order was prompted by these delivery inconsistencies, not a change in my needs.

2.  *LEGAL BREACH ON ADVERTISED TERMS:* Your platform explicitly advertises "Free Shipping" for orders over a certain threshold, and my account has a "10% Recurring Benefit." Conditioning the delivery of Order #16045 on the removal of this 10% discount to offset shipping costs is a violation of *§ 5 UWG (Bait Advertising) and Decree-Law 57/2008*. I paid €473.85 on Jan 16—covering the full price of 246L—only to have the order "updated" later that same day with an additional €145 surcharge. Under *§ 312a para. 3 BGB and DL 24/2014*, such unilateral post-checkout surcharges require express consent and are otherwise legally void. Since my delivery address is in Germany, *EU Regulation 593/2008 (Rome I)* ensures I am protected by these laws regardless of your branch location.

3.  *UNRESOLVED MATERIAL BREACHES & GOOD FAITH:* I want to be very clear: I have acted with extreme patience despite your prior performance failures. Cartons missing, rotten milk, and items contaminated with black sticky substances constitute material breaches of contract under *§ 433 BGB*. I have a full dossier ready regarding these unresolved damage claims and the current fee manipulation. However, I am currently *holding back* these formal filings because I would sincerely prefer to move forward as a loyal customer today rather than an adversary. To be met with new surcharges after I overlooked your prior failures is a response that amounted to a slap in the face.

4.  *RELIANCE ON PERFORMANCE:* I must clarify that I have relied on this specific shipment for my inventory planning after your repeated 70L delays. A unilateral cancellation or "refund" would not resolve this; it would only amplify the damage by leaving me without supply. I am asserting my right to **Specific Performance**—the delivery of the goods as promised—rather than a return to the status quo. 

5.  *LOGISTICAL NECESSITY:* I carefully calculated my available storage space, and *246 Liters is exactly the maximum capacity I have.* This is not an arbitrary number; it is a logistical necessity for my planning. I have already cleared my schedule and prepared my intake area specifically for this bulk delivery.

*My Goal:*
I honestly do not want to escalate this to a full legal dispute. I have prepared the formal dossiers for *ASAE*, the *Livro de Reclamações*, and the *Verbraucherzentrale* regarding the *§ 312a BGB* violations and the unresolved damage claims, but *I have not submitted them yet.* I am holding back a full escalation because I value our long-term relationship. I would much rather solve this professionally today and move on to a new, low-friction ordering schedule.

*My Proposal:*
Since I have already paid the full amount "under protest" to ensure my supply line isn't interrupted, I require you to:
1.  *Correct the Pricing Discrepancy:* My paid amount of €473.85 was more than enough to cover the 246L order (Subtotal €479.70, reduced to €431.73 with my 10% discount). I require the erroneous "Payment Due" balance of €150.85 to be waived immediately.
2.  *Process the Overpayment:* The difference between my payment (€473.85) and the correct discounted total (€431.73) results in a surplus of *€42.12*. This amount should be credited back to my account or applied to the order.
3.  *Waive the €145 Fee:* Ensure no shipping charges are applied to this 246L shipment, honoring your advertised offer.
4.  *Collaborative Future Terms:* I am prepared to move to a consolidated schedule (Monthly 200L+) to significantly reduce your logistical overhead, provided my 10% discount and free shipping status are formally preserved.

Once this is sorted, I am ready to finalize this new consolidated schedule to ensure a sustainable and low-friction partnership for both of us.
Please help me solve this quickly so we can continue on good terms.

Best regards,
Dolev Tenenboim <This message was edited>
17/01/2026, 15:44 - ÷×: I see that my previous communications are being ignored.

To avoid any misunderstanding: I *explicitly reject any cancellation or refund*. I paid for the goods, and I demand their delivery (*Specific Performance*). This specific order is a *strict necessity* for my requirements and cannot be substituted.

*PART 1: ACCOUNT HISTORY & YOUR CONDUCT*

1. *Coercion to Bulk Orders:* My purchase history shows I maintained weekly *70L recurring orders* with a *10% discount* and *free shipping*. Your system repeatedly delayed/cancelled these orders, which you then consolidated into a single *180L shipment pre-Christmas*. This proves your logistics team has handled large orders under my original terms before. The transition to this *246L order* was prompted by *your delivery inconsistencies*, not a change in my needs.

2. *Sneaky Discount Removal:* You coerced me into accumulating this bulk order to solve *your* shipping logistics, a sneaky tactic effectively designed to strip my *10% recurring discount*. I was willing to overlook this loss just to secure my supply. To now demand *further surcharges* on top of that is a *spit in the face* of a cooperative customer.

3. *Unresolved Material Breaches:* I have acted with extreme patience despite your prior performance failures. Cartons with *rotten milk, and items contaminated with black sticky substances* constitute material breaches of contract under *§ 433 BGB*. 

4. *Logistical Necessity:* I carefully calculated my available storage space, and *246 Liters is exactly the maximum capacity I have*. This is not an arbitrary number; it is a logistical necessity. I have already cleared my schedule and prepared my intake area specifically for this bulk delivery.

*PART 2: LEGAL VIOLATIONS*

You are currently in violation of your own written policies and multiple EU/German statutes:

1. *Bad Faith Inducement (Coercion) – § 242 BGB:* You induced me to switch from weekly 70L orders to bulk orders to solve *your* logistics, then punished me by removing my 10% discount. This contradictory behavior (*"Venire contra factum proprium"*) is a fundamental violation of Good Faith under German law.

2. *Concluded Contract – Revolut:* I paid via *Revolut Instant Settlement* on January 16th. Under German case law, demanding and accepting immediate payment concludes the contract instantly. You have *no legal right* to unilaterally alter the price post-payment.

3. *Illegal "Button Solution" Violation – § 312j BGB:* German law mandates that the *TOTAL price* (including all shipping) must be clearly visible on the final "Buy" button *before payment*. Your own policy text states you will inform customers about extra fees *after placing the order*. This is an *explicit confession* to violating this mandatory law. Such clauses are *legally void*.

4. *Void "Surprising Clause" – § 305c BGB:* Your surcharge clause is *buried in micro-text at the very bottom* of your shipping policy (Item 12). Any term in general terms and conditions that is unusual and that the customer could not reasonably expect is considered a "Surprising Clause" and is *legally invalid and void*. You cannot retroactively apply hidden clauses that contradict the *"Free Shipping >€99"* clearly advertised at checkout.

5. *Illegal Post-Checkout Surcharges – § 312a Abs. 3 BGB / DL 24/2014:* Demanding €150+ *after* I paid €473.85 requires my *express consent*. I did not consent. This surcharge is *legally void*.

6. *Drip Pricing & Bait Advertising – § 5 UWG / EU Omnibus Directive:* Advertising "Free Shipping" for orders >€99 while hiding mandatory surcharges in the fine print constitutes *misleading advertising* and an *Unfair Commercial Practice*.

7. *Aggressive Commercial Practice – EU Directive 2005/29/EC:* Withholding fully paid goods to demand an additional surcharge is classified as an *"Aggressive Commercial Practice"* under the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.

*PART 3: MY DEMAND*

Since I have already paid the full amount (€473.85) *"under protest"* to ensure my supply line isn't interrupted, I require you to:

*Correct the Pricing Discrepancy:* The 246L order (Subtotal €479.70) reduced to *€431.73* with my 10% discount. I require the erroneous "Payment Due" balance of *€150.85* to be waived immediately.

*Process the Overpayment:* The difference between my payment (€473.85) and the correct discounted total (€431.73) results in a surplus of *€42.12*. This amount must be credited back to my account.

*Waive the €150 Fee:* This fee is legally void. Remove the shipping charge and release the order immediately.

*Future Terms:* I am prepared to consolidate to a *Monthly 200L+ schedule* to reduce your logistical overhead, provided my *10% discount* and *Free Shipping status* are formally preserved.
17/01/2026, 15:46 - ÷×: I am setting a final deadline: *Monday, Jan 19 at 6:00 PM.*

If I do not receive confirmation that the fee is waived and the shipment is released by this time, I will proceed with filing the formal complaints for *Unfair Commercial Practices* and *Breach of Contract* immediately on Tuesday morning.

Expect no further warnings,

Dolev Tenenboim
