with head oﬃce at Parque Industrial Armés, Bloco 3, Armazém S - Armés, 2715-771 Terrugem-Sintra,
hereinafter MADE IN MARKET®, is the exclusive owner of all content and information on this website and
the trading company responsible for the billing and supply of products purchased through the same. 
The purchase of products in the online store of the MADE IN
MARKET® website, www.madeinmarket.eu presupposes acceptance of these terms and conditions.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to freely modify the terms and conditions contained herein, within
the scope of applicable law, without prior notice.
Object
1. These terms and conditions are intended to regulate the provision of services of the online store MADE
IN MARKET®.
2. The purchase of any product through the online store implies acceptance of these terms and conditions.
3. Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration. 
Product and Price Information
1. MADE IN MARKET® takes into account the information on the essential characteristics of the products;
however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
2. MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any diﬀerences and/or changes concerning the information
on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents
that accompany the product before use or consumption.
3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
4 / 10\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.
7. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is
announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment
1. To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be
purchased should be added to the "shopping cart". To ﬁnalize the purchase and check out, it is
necessary to conﬁrm the order and provide information regarding the means of payment, shipping
method, and billing
2. Orders placed in the online store will only be processed after payment has been received.
3. Accepted payment methods are VISA®, MasterCard®, Discover®, American Express®, Paypal®, iDeal,
MBWAY, Bank Transfer (ATM), Google Pay® or Apple Pay®, Amazon Pay®, and Made in Market® Gift
Card. Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc.,
Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
4. To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift
card details online after selecting this payment method.
5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds
the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order
contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the
customer).
5 / 10\nShipping Costs

Right of withdrawal
You have the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason. The withdrawal

taken or have taken possession of the last goods.
To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must contact us (Impeccable Place: Warehouse & Distributions LDA,
Parque Industrial Armés Bloco 3, Armazém S, 2715-771 Sintra, Lisboa, Portugal, info@madeinmarket.eu,
telephone: +351 210 508 653) by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post or an e-mail) of your
decision to revoke this contract. For this purpose, you may use the enclosed sample revocation form, which

To comply with the withdrawal period, it is suﬃcient that you send notiﬁcation of the exercise of the right of
9 / 10\nwithdrawal before the expiration of the withdrawal period.
Consequences of the revocation
If you revoke this contract, we shall reimburse you for all payments we have received from you, including
delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of
delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery oﬀered by us), without undue delay and no later
than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless
expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees because of this repayment. We
may refuse repayment until we have received the goods back or until you have provided proof that you have
returned the goods, whichever is earlier.

which you notify us of the revocation of this contract. The deadline is met if you send the goods before the
expiration of the fourteen-day period. You shall bear the direct costs of returning the goods. You will only
have to pay for any loss in value of the goods if this loss in value is due to handling of the goods that is not

Contracts for the delivery of goods that can spoil quickly or whose expiration date would be quickly
exceeded.

Legal Notice
IMPECCABLE PLACE - WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTIONS LDA, hereinafter IMPECCABLE PLACE, a legal entity
with a single registration number and NIPC 516693468, registered at the Odivelas Registrar of Companies,
with head oﬃce at Parque Industrial Armés, Bloco 3, Armazém S - Armés, 2715-771 Terrugem-Sintra,
hereinafter MADE IN MARKET®, is the exclusive owner of all content and information on this website and
the trading company responsible for the billing and supply of products purchased through the same. 
The purchase of products in the online store of the MADE IN
MARKET® website, www.madeinmarket.eu presupposes acceptance of these terms and conditions.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to freely modify the terms and conditions contained herein, within
the scope of applicable law, without prior notice.
Object
1. These terms and conditions are intended to regulate the provision of services of the online store MADE
IN MARKET®.
2. The purchase of any product through the online store implies acceptance of these terms and conditions.
3. Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration. 
Product and Price Information
1. MADE IN MARKET® takes into account the information on the essential characteristics of the products;
however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
2. MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any diﬀerences and/or changes concerning the information
on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents
that accompany the product before use or consumption.
3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
4 / 10\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.
7. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is
announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment
1. To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be
purchased should be added to the "shopping cart". To ﬁnalize the purchase and check out, it is
necessary to conﬁrm the order and provide information regarding the means of payment, shipping
method, and billing
2. Orders placed in the online store will only be processed after payment has been received.
3. Accepted payment methods are VISA®, MasterCard®, Discover®, American Express®, Paypal®, iDeal,
MBWAY, Bank Transfer (ATM), Google Pay® or Apple Pay®, Amazon Pay®, and Made in Market® Gift
Card. Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc.,
Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
4. To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift
card details online after selecting this payment method.
5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds
the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order
contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the
customer).
5 / 10\nShipping Costs

informed by MADE IN MARKET® about the applicable extra shipping fee after placing the order, along with a request for payment of the
additional charge. Some products, such as mineral water or milk, have purchase quantity restrictions.

with information that allows the tracking of the order and thus organizes the delivery with some

taken or have taken possession of the last goods.
To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must contact us (Impeccable Place: Warehouse & Distributions LDA,
Parque Industrial Armés Bloco 3, Armazém S, 2715-771 Sintra, Lisboa, Portugal, info@madeinmarket.eu,
telephone: +351 210 508 653) by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post or an e-mail) of your

9 / 10\nwithdrawal before the expiration of the withdrawal period.
Consequences of the revocation
If you revoke this contract, we shall reimburse you for all payments we have received from you, including
delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of
delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery oﬀered by us), without undue delay and no later
than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless
expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees because of this repayment. We
may refuse repayment until we have received the goods back or until you have provided proof that you have
returned the goods, whichever is earlier.

which you notify us of the revocation of this contract. The deadline is met if you send the goods before the
expiration of the fourteen-day period. You shall bear the direct costs of returning the goods. You will only

The right of withdrawal does not apply to the following contracts:
Contracts for the delivery of goods that can spoil quickly or whose expiration date would be quickly
exceeded.
Contracts for the delivery of sealed goods that are not suitable for return for reasons of health

MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to freely modify the terms and conditions contained herein, within
the scope of applicable law, without prior notice.

2. The purchase of any product through the online store implies acceptance of these terms and conditions.
3. Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration. 
Product and Price Information
1. MADE IN MARKET® takes into account the information on the essential characteristics of the products;
however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
2. MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any diﬀerences and/or changes concerning the information
on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents
that accompany the product before use or consumption.
3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
6 / 12\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.
7. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is
announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment
1. To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be
purchased should be added to the "shopping cart". To ﬁnalize the purchase and check out, it is
necessary to conﬁrm the order and provide information regarding the means of payment, shipping
method, and billing
2. Orders placed in the online store will only be processed after payment has been received.
3. Accepted payment methods are VISA®, MasterCard®, Discover®, American Express®, Paypal®, iDeal,
MBWAY, Bank Transfer (ATM), Google Pay® or Apple Pay®, Amazon Pay®, and Made in Market® Gift
Card. Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc.,
Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
4. To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift
card details online after selecting this payment method.
5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds
the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order
contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the
customer).

MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to freely modify the terms and conditions contained herein, within
the scope of applicable law, without prior notice.

however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
2. MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any diﬀerences and/or changes concerning the information
on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents
that accompany the product before use or consumption.
3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
4 / 10\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.
7. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is
announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment
1. To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be
purchased should be added to the "shopping cart". To ﬁnalize the purchase and check out, it is
necessary to conﬁrm the order and provide information regarding the means of payment, shipping
method, and billing
2. Orders placed in the online store will only be processed after payment has been received.
3. Accepted payment methods are VISA®, MasterCard®, Discover®, American Express®, Paypal®, iDeal,
MBWAY, Bank Transfer (ATM), Google Pay® or Apple Pay®, Amazon Pay®, and Made in Market® Gift
Card. Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc.,
Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
4. To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift
card details online after selecting this payment method.
5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds
the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order
contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the
customer).

delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of
delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery oﬀered by us), without undue delay and no later
than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless
expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees because of this repayment. We
may refuse repayment until we have received the goods back or until you have provided proof that you have

may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.
7. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is
announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment
1. To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be
purchased should be added to the "shopping cart". To ﬁnalize the purchase and check out, it is
necessary to conﬁrm the order and provide information regarding the means of payment, shipping

4. To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift

5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds
the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order
contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the
customer).

than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless

                            PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This communication serves as a formal rejection of any settlement offers or attempted rescissions and establishes the final period for
compliance prior to the initiation of legal proceedings.
Regulatory filings and administrative complaints are currently being finalized for immediate submission.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
I.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY
1.    On 16 January 2026, I placed Order #16045 and paid €473.85 via Revolut
      Instant Settlement. The contract was concluded upon acceptance of payment.
2.    On 17 January 2026 at 15:44, I served detailed written notice via
      WhatsApp setting forth the legal basis of this dispute and explicitly
      rejecting any cancellation or refund.
3.    On 17 January 2026, I set a final deadline: Monday, 19 January 2026
      at 18:00 (CET) for confirmation of delivery.
4.    On 19 January 2026, you attempted a single telephone call at 13:23.
      No response was provided. No written communication followed. You had five (5) hours
      to respond in writing before the deadline. No attempt at performance or clarification was made.
5. *  The deadline of 19 January 2026 at 18:00 expired without performance.*
6.    On 20 January 2026, I served a Formal Notice of Default declaring you
      in Verzug pursuant to §§ 280, 286 BGB. I explicitly rejected any
      cancellation, withdrawal, or refund.
7.    On 20 January 2026, immediately prior to the issuance of the refund, you attempted a second telephone call. Consistent with your
previous conduct, no message, text, or voicemail was provided. This constituted a singular, unrepeated contact attempt.
8.    Following this second insufficient contact attempt, you unilaterally issued a refund of €473.85 in direct contravention of my explicit
written instructions.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
II.   FORMAL REJECTION OF YOUR ATTEMPTED RESCISSION
Pursuant to §§ 280, 281, 286 BGB, I hereby reject your unilateral refund
and attempted rescission of the contract.
*The issuance of a refund does not extinguish the existing default.* The attempted cancellation does not terminate my established
contractual rights. The contract remains legally binding.
*The unilaterally issued refund is expressly rejected as a valid discharge of your contractual obligations.* I maintain the demand for
specific performance of the contract via delivery of the goods.
The €473.85 has been received into my account without my consent. I am
holding these funds as security pending resolution. Upon confirmed delivery
of Order #16045, I will arrange return of these funds.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
III.  LEGAL STATUS
*You are in Default (Verzug).*
The deadline of 19 January 2026 at 18:00 has passed. You failed to perform.
Your subsequent attempt to cancel the contract does not reset the clock.
It aggravates the existing breach of duty.
Pursuant to the German Civil Code (BGB), the following rights are hereby formally invoked:
Exported using Save Emails as PDF by cloudHQ
1 / 3\n1. Right to Specific Performance (Erfüllung) pursuant to §§ 433, 281 BGB:
This right is hereby ASSERTED. I maintain a definitive demand for the immediate delivery of the subject matter of the contract. The
attempted rescission of the
contract is rejected as legally ineffective.                                                                         
2. Right to Damages for Delay (Verzögerungsschaden) pursuant to §§ 280, 286 BGB:
This right is FORMALLY RESERVED. The trader is liable for all material damages caused by the delay, including but not limited to statutory
default interest, compensation for futile expenditures, and the costs of legal representation.
3. Right to Damages in Lieu of Performance (Schadensersatz statt der Leistung) pursuant to § 281 Abs. 4 BGB:
This right is FORMALLY RESERVED. I expressly reserve the right to execute a cover purchase (Deckungskauf) from a third-party supplier
at your expense and to claim the total price differential as damages.
*I have not yet elected to claim damages in lieu of performance.* I am
demanding delivery. However, I expressly reserve the right to exercise
§ 281 Abs. 4 BGB at any time and pursue a cover purchase at your expense.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IV.   NOTICE OF IMMEDIATE REGULATORY ACTION
The deadline I set has passed. You have now compounded your breach with an
illegal attempt to rescind the contract against my explicit written objection.
*I am proceeding with regulatory filings immediately.*
The following complaints are being prepared for submission:
      •  Verbraucherzentrale (German Consumer Protection)
      •  ASAE (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica – Portugal)
      •  Livro de Reclamações (Portuguese Official Complaints Register)
      •  EU Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform
      •  Revolut – Formal Merchant Misconduct Report
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
V.    FINAL PERIOD FOR VOLUNTARY REMEDIATION
I am not required to offer you any further opportunity to perform. You have
already missed one deadline and attempted illegal rescission.
However, in the interest of resolution, I am prepared to suspend the
filing of regulatory complaints for a period of *twelve (12) hours* from
the timestamp of this communication.
If, within that period, you provide written confirmation that you will:
      1.  Reverse the cancellation and reinstate Order #16045;
      2.  Apply my 10% Recurring Discount (corrected total: €431.73);
      3.  Ship the order immediately with €0 shipping as advertised;
      4.  Credit the €42.12 overpayment to my account;
      5.  Confirm preservation of my account terms for future orders;
Compliance with the aforementioned demands within the designated timeframe will result in the formal settlement of this dispute. Failure
to comply will result in the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of this resolution offer and the subsequent initiation of the
administrative and judicial proceedings detailed herein.
*This period serves as a final opportunity for the voluntary cure of your default.* No further warnings or extensions will be granted.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VI. CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
If written confirmation is not received within the designated twelve (12) hour period:
1. Regulatory Filing: All prepared regulatory and administrative complaints will be filed immediately and without further warning.
2. Legal Escalation: I reserve the right to refer this matter to external counsel for judicial enforcement. In such an event, all legal fees
(calculated pursuant to the RVG) shall be claimed as damages for delay (Verzugsschaden) under § 286 BGB.
Exported using Save Emails as PDF by cloudHQ
2 / 3\n3. Cover Purchase: I reserve the right to exercise my rights under § 281 Abs. 4 BGB, perform a cover purchase (Deckungskauf), and pursue
your company for the total price differential.
4. Public Record: Detailed factual reviews and documentation of this conduct will be published on Trustpilot, Google, and relevant consumer
protection forums.
*I expressly reserve all rights and remedies available under law.*

I.    FORMAL DECLARATION OF DEFAULT
The final deadline set for performance—*Monday, 19 January 2026 at 18:00 (CET)*—has expired without delivery of goods or written
confirmation from your side.
*You are hereby formally declared to be in default (Verzug) pursuant to §§ 280, 286 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch
– BGB).*
I note for the record that you received my detailed communication via WhatsApp on 17 January 2026 at 15:44. You failed to respond in
writing.
*   You attempted a single telephone call on *Monday, 19 January 2026 at 13:23*.
*   You left no voicemail.
*   You sent no text message.
*   You provided *zero written response*.
You had approximately five (5) hours between that unanswered call and the 18:00 deadline to confirm your compliance via email,
WhatsApp, or any other written medium. You chose silence. A single unanswered telephone call, absent any follow-up, does not constitute
performance of the contract, nor does it constitute a valid response to the serious legal allegations set forth herein.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II.   REJECTION OF RESCISSION – DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
*I hereby explicitly reject any cancellation, withdrawal, or refund.*
I have paid for the goods in full. I demand *immediate delivery of the fully paid order without any surcharge* (Erfüllung / Specific
Performance).
This order consists of essential food products which constitute a strict necessity for my personal requirements. Your continued non-
performance and deliberate silence have already caused foreseeable nutritional disruption.
*I expressly reserve all claims for consequential material damages (Verzugsschaden) arising from your delay pursuant to § 280 Abs. 1, 2
BGB in conjunction with § 286 BGB.*
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III.  UNCONTESTED FACTS
My detailed communication sent on 17 January 2026 (15:44) outlines the factual and legal basis of this dispute. As you have failed to
contest these points in writing, they are deemed admitted pursuant to standard evidentiary procedure.
The full text of that communication is appended below as *ANNEX A* for the formal record.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IV.   LEGAL VIOLATIONS
You are in violation of your own written policies and multiple provisions of EU and German law:
1.    *BAD FAITH INDUCEMENT – § 242 BGB (Treu und Glauben)*
      You induced me to switch from weekly 70L orders to bulk orders to solve
      *your* logistics problems, then punished me by removing my 10% discount.
Exported using Save Emails as PDF by cloudHQ
1 / 8\n      This contradictory behavior ("Venire contra factum proprium") is a
      fundamental violation of the Good Faith principle under German law.
2.    *CONCLUDED CONTRACT – IMMEDIATE PAYMENT VIA REVOLUT*
      I paid via Revolut Instant Settlement on 16 January 2026. Under German
      case law, demanding and accepting immediate payment concludes the contract
      instantly. You have *no legal right* to unilaterally alter the price or
      terms post-payment.
3.    *ILLEGAL "BUTTON SOLUTION" VIOLATION – § 312j BGB*
      German law mandates that the *TOTAL price* (including all shipping and
      additional costs) must be clearly visible on the final order button *before*
      the consumer clicks to confirm payment. Your own policy text admits that
      you inform customers about extra fees *after* placing the order. This is an
      *explicit confession* to violating this mandatory statutory requirement.
      Such clauses are *legally void*.
4.    *VOID "SURPRISING CLAUSE" – § 305c BGB (Überraschende Klauseln)*
      Your surcharge clause is *buried in micro-text at the very bottom* of
      your shipping policy (Item 12). Under § 305c BGB, any term in general
      terms and conditions that is so unusual that the consumer could not
      reasonably expect it is considered a "Surprising Clause" and is *legally
      invalid and void*. You cannot retroactively apply hidden clauses that
      contradict the *"Free Shipping for orders over €99"* clearly advertised
      at checkout.
5.    *ILLEGAL POST-CHECKOUT SURCHARGES – § 312a Abs. 3 BGB / DL 24/2014*
      Demanding €150+ *after* I paid €473.85 requires my *express consent*.
      I did not consent. This surcharge demand is *legally void*.
6.    *DRIP PRICING & BAIT ADVERTISING – § 5 UWG / EU Omnibus Directive*
      Advertising "Free Shipping" for orders exceeding €99 while concealing
      mandatory surcharges in the fine print constitutes *misleading advertising*
      and an *Unfair Commercial Practice* under the German Act Against Unfair
      Competition and the EU Omnibus Directive (EU) 2019/2161.
7.    *AGGRESSIVE COMMERCIAL PRACTICE – EU Directive 2005/29/EC*
      Withholding fully paid goods in order to demand an additional surcharge
      is classified as an *"Aggressive Commercial Practice"* under Article 8
      of the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. Such conduct significantly
      impairs the consumer's freedom of choice through coercion.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V.    EXPANDED LIABILITY & DEMANDS
Because you are now in default (Verzug), my claims against you have expanded. I hereby demand:
1.    *IMMEDIATE DELIVERY (SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE)*
      Release Order #16045 immediately without surcharge.
2.    *WAIVE THE SHIPPING SURCHARGE*
      The €145-150 shipping fee demand is *legally void*. Remove this charge
      and release the order for shipment immediately.
3.    *CORRECT THE PRICING DISCREPANCY*
      The 246L order (Subtotal €479.70) reduces to *€431.73* with my 10%
      discount. The erroneous "Payment Due" balance of *€150.85* must be
      waived immediately.
4.    *PROCESS THE OVERPAYMENT*
      The difference between my payment (€473.85) and the correct discounted
      total (€431.73) results in a surplus of *€42.12*. This amount must be
      credited back to my account or refunded immediately.
5.    *DEFAULT INTEREST – § 288 BGB*
      I claim statutory default interest (5 percentage points above base rate)
      on the withheld funds, calculated from 19 January 2026 until the date
      of delivery.
6.    *COMPENSATION FOR FUTILE EXPENSES – § 284 BGB*
      I have incurred wasted costs in time and labor preparing my storage
      facility and clearing my schedule for a delivery you failed to make.
Exported using Save Emails as PDF by cloudHQ
2 / 8\n      I reserve the right to invoice you for these costs if delivery is not
      confirmed within 24 hours.
7.    *RESTORATION OF ACCOUNT STATUS*
      I demand written confirmation that my *10% Recurring Discount* and
      *Free Shipping* status are permanently restored for all future orders,
      correcting your bad faith manipulation of my account terms.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI.   ESCALATION NOTICE
The deadline of *Monday, 19 January 2026 at 18:00* has expired.
I am now proceeding with filing formal complaints for Unfair Commercial Practices and Breach of Contract with the following
authorities and institutions:
*   *Verbraucherzentrale* (German Consumer Protection Agency)
*   *ASAE* (Autoridade de Segurança Alimentar e Económica – Portugal)
*   *Livro de Reclamações* (Portuguese Official Complaints Register)
*   *EU Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform*
*   *Revolut* – Merchant Misconduct Report
I reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to claims for specific performance, damages for delay
(Verzugsschaden), and compensation for any consequential losses arising from your breach.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VII.  FINAL NOTICE
*Any further communication regarding this matter must be in writing.*
*Confirm immediate delivery of Order #16045 to avoid further complications and escalation.*
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                              ANNEX A
        RECORD OF PRIOR COMMUNICATION (Sent via WhatsApp: 17 January 2026, 15:44)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
I see that my previous communications are being ignored.
To avoid any misunderstanding: I *explicitly reject any cancellation or refund*. I paid for the goods, and I demand their delivery
(*Specific Performance*). This specific order is a *strict necessity* for my requirements and cannot be substituted.
*PART 1: ACCOUNT HISTORY & YOUR CONDUCT*
1. *Coercion to Bulk Orders:* My purchase history shows I maintained weekly *70L recurring orders* with a *10% discount* and *free
shipping*. Your system repeatedly delayed/cancelled these orders, which you then consolidated into a single *180L shipment pre-
Christmas*. This proves your logistics team has handled large orders under my original terms before. The transition to this *246L order*
was prompted by *your delivery inconsistencies*, not a change in my needs.
2. *Sneaky Discount Removal:* You coerced me into accumulating this bulk order to solve *your* shipping logistics, a sneaky tactic
effectively designed to strip my *10% recurring discount*. I was willing to overlook this loss just to secure my supply. To now demand
*further surcharges* on top of that is a *spit in the face* of a cooperative customer.
3. *Unresolved Material Breaches:* I have acted with extreme patience despite your prior performance failures. Cartons with *rotten
milk, and items contaminated with black sticky substances* constitute material breaches of contract under *§ 433 BGB*.
4. *Logistical Necessity:* I carefully calculated my available storage space, and *246 Liters is exactly the maximum capacity I have*.
This is not an arbitrary number; it is a logistical necessity. I have already cleared my schedule and prepared my intake area specifically for
this bulk delivery.

3 / 8\n*PART 2: LEGAL VIOLATIONS*
You are currently in violation of your own written policies and multiple EU/German statutes:
1. *Bad Faith Inducement (Coercion) – § 242 BGB:* You induced me to switch from weekly 70L orders to bulk orders to solve *your*
logistics, then punished me by removing my 10% discount. This contradictory behavior (*"Venire contra factum proprium"*) is a
fundamental violation of Good Faith under German law.
2. *Concluded Contract – Revolut:* I paid via *Revolut Instant Settlement* on January 16th. Under German case law, demanding and
accepting immediate payment concludes the contract instantly. You have *no legal right* to unilaterally alter the price post-payment.
3. *Illegal "Button Solution" Violation – § 312j BGB:* German law mandates that the *TOTAL price* (including all shipping) must be
clearly visible on the final "Buy" button *before payment*. Your own policy text states you will inform customers about extra fees *after
placing the order*. This is an *explicit confession* to violating this mandatory law. Such clauses are *legally void*.
4. *Void "Surprising Clause" – § 305c BGB:* Your surcharge clause is *buried in micro-text at the very bottom* of your shipping policy
(Item 12). Any term in general terms and conditions that is unusual and that the customer could not reasonably expect is considered a
"Surprising Clause" and is *legally invalid and void*. You cannot retroactively apply hidden clauses that contradict the *"Free Shipping
>€99"* clearly advertised at checkout.
5. *Illegal Post-Checkout Surcharges – § 312a Abs. 3 BGB / DL 24/2014:* Demanding €150+ *after* I paid €473.85 requires my
*express consent*. I did not consent. This surcharge is *legally void*.
6. *Drip Pricing & Bait Advertising – § 5 UWG / EU Omnibus Directive:* Advertising "Free Shipping" for orders >€99 while hiding
mandatory surcharges in the fine print constitutes *misleading advertising* and an *Unfair Commercial Practice*.
7. *Aggressive Commercial Practice – EU Directive 2005/29/EC:* Withholding fully paid goods to demand an additional surcharge is
classified as an *"Aggressive Commercial Practice"* under the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.
*PART 3: MY DEMAND*
Since I have already paid the full amount (€473.85) *"under protest"* to ensure my supply line isn't interrupted, I require you to:
*   *Correct the Pricing Discrepancy:* The 246L order (Subtotal €479.70) reduced to *€431.73* with my 10% discount. I require the
erroneous "Payment Due" balance of *€150.85* to be waived immediately.
*   *Process the Overpayment:* The difference between my payment (€473.85) and the correct discounted total (€431.73) results in a
surplus of *€42.12*. This amount must be credited back to my account.
*   *Waive the €150 Fee:* This fee is legally void. Remove the shipping charge and release the order immediately.
*   *Future Terms:* I am prepared to consolidate to a *Monthly 200L+ schedule* to reduce your logistical overhead, provided my *10%
discount* and *Free Shipping status* are formally preserved.
*I am setting a final deadline: Monday, Jan 19 at 6:00 PM.*
If I do not receive confirmation that the fee is waived and the shipment is released by this time, I will proceed with filing the formal
complaints for Unfair Commercial Practices and Breach of Contract immediately on Tuesday morning.
Expect no further warnings,
Dolev Tenenboim

*   *Correct the Pricing Discrepancy:* The 246L order (Subtotal €479.70) reduced to *€431.73* with my 10% discount. I require the
erroneous "Payment Due" balance of *€150.85* to be waived immediately.
*   *Process the Overpayment:* The difference between my payment (€473.85) and the correct discounted total (€431.73) results in a
surplus of *€42.12*. This amount must be credited back to my account.
*   *Waive the €150 Fee:* This fee is legally void. Remove the shipping charge and release the order immediately.
*   *Future Terms:* I am prepared to consolidate to a *Monthly 200L+ schedule* to reduce your logistical overhead, provided my *10%
discount* and *Free Shipping status* are formally preserved.
*I am setting a final deadline: Monday, Jan 19 at 6:00 PM.*
If I do not receive confirmation that the fee is waived and the shipment is released by this time, I will proceed with filing the formal
complaints for Unfair Commercial Practices and Breach of Contract immediately on Tuesday morning.
Expect no further warnings,
Dolev Tenenboim

──────────────────────
ARTICLE II – SUBSCRIPTION TERMS
Section 2.1 – Nature of Agreement. This Agreement constitutes a Continuing Obligation  
(Dauerschuldverhältnis) under German law. The Supplier shall deliver, and the Customer shall  
accept and pay for, the Products on a weekly basis.
Section 2.2 – Product Specifications. The initial order quantity is seventy (70) units of Products (70  
Litres) per week, subject to modification pursuant to Section 2.7.
Section 2.3 – Pricing (Recurring Discount). The Price shall be the Supplier's standard list price  
LESS the Customer's ten percent (10%) Recurring Customer Discount. This discount is a material  
condition of this subscription. Any change to the list price applies automatically, provided the 10%  
discount is maintained.
Section 2.4 – Shipping. The Supplier shall deliver at no shipping cost (€0.00) for orders meeting the  
Free Shipping Threshold, in accordance with the Supplier's published policy. No shipping charges,  
surcharges, or ancillary fees shall apply to qualifying orders.
Section 2.5 – Free Shipping Threshold. The Free Shipping Threshold is €99.00 order value. Orders  
below this threshold shall be subject to standard shipping charges as published by the Supplier.
Section 2.6 – Payment. The Customer shall pay in full for each delivery via the registered payment  
method upon invoice generation.
Section 2.7 – Order Quantity Modification. The Customer reserves the right to modify the weekly  
order quantity by providing written notice at least 48 hours prior to the next scheduled shipment.
Section 2.8 – Duration. This Agreement is of indefinite duration (unbefristet), continuing until  
properly terminated per Article III.
ARTICLE III – TERM AND TERMINATION
Section 3.1 – Fixed Contractual Term. This Agreement shall have a fixed initial term commencing  
on the Effective Date and expiring on January 22, 2027 (the "Fixed Term").
Section 3.2 – Exclusion of Ordinary Termination by Supplier. During the Fixed Term, the right of  
the Supplier to terminate this Agreement for convenience (ordinary termination) is excluded. The  
Supplier guarantees the continuous supply of the Products at the agreed Price throughout the Fixed  
Term.
Section 3.3 – Customer Termination Rights. The Customer retains the right to terminate this  
Agreement for convenience at any time upon providing thirty (30) days' written notice to the  
3 / 6\nSupplier.
Section 3.4 – Termination for Good Cause. The right of either party to terminate this Agreement for  
good cause (wichtiger Grund) pursuant to § 314 BGB remains unaffected. For the avoidance of  
doubt, the following do not ordinarily constitute good cause, absent exceptional circumstances and  
concrete proof rendering continuation unreasonable even for the notice period:
(a) Logistics/Shipping: delivery costs; fuel prices; carrier surcharges; claims that free shipping is  
unviable; product weight/volume; cross-border complexity.
(b) Commercial/Business: discontinuing regional service; pricing policy changes; low profit  
margins; removing customer benefits; administrative burden; restructuring.
(c) Economic: inflation; currency fluctuations; supplier price increases; market changes; the  
contract proving less profitable than anticipated.
Section 3.5 – Effect of Termination. Termination ends future performance obligations but does not  
affect payment obligations for orders already delivered.
Section 3.6 – Continuity of Performance. During any ordinary notice period, the Supplier shall  
continue weekly deliveries on the agreed schedule and terms. Any cessation, suspension, or  
reduction of deliveries during such notice period without lawful basis shall constitute a material  
breach of this Agreement.
ARTICLE IV – FORCE MAJEURE
Section 4.1 – Effect of Force Majeure. Neither party is liable for delay or failure to perform to the  
extent caused by a Force Majeure Event.
Section 4.2 – Suspension, Not Termination. Force Majeure does not, by itself, constitute good cause  
for termination. Performance obligations are suspended only for the duration of the Force Majeure  
Event.
Section 4.3 – Notice. The affected party shall notify the other party without undue delay, specifying  
the nature of the event and its expected duration.
Section 4.4 – Resumption. Upon cessation of the Force Majeure Event, the Supplier shall resume  
deliveries within fourteen (14) days under the same terms.
Section 4.5 – Exclusions. Force Majeure does not include cost increases, economic hardship,  
supplier price increases, logistics costs, or circumstances within the Supplier’s reasonable control.
ARTICLE V – ACCEPTANCE AND FORMATION
Section 5.1 – Acceptance by Performance. By processing and shipping the next weekly order, the 
Supplier is deemed to have unconditionally accepted all terms herein. Such acceptance is binding 
and irrevocable.
Section 5.2 – Objection Procedure. Should the Supplier disagree with any term:
(a)Timing: Written objection must be received by the Customer within seven (7) calendar 
days of the Supplier's receipt of this Agreement, and in any event prior to processing 
the next order.
(b)Content: Objection must specify the particular provisions objected to and propose 
alternative terms.
(c)No Delay of Performance: Filing an objection does not suspend the Supplier's 
obligation to perform under the subscription. Deliveries must continue during any 
4 / 6\nnegotiation period. The objection mechanism relates solely to the specific disputed terms  
and does not affect the core performance obligation.
(d)Maximum Negotiation Period: If objection is filed, the parties shall negotiate in good 
faith for a maximum of fourteen (14) days. If no agreement is reached within this period,  
the Customer's original terms shall govern, and continued performance by the Supplier 
thereafter constitutes acceptance.
(e)Prohibition on Delay Exploitation: The objection mechanism may not be used to 
delay, obstruct, or avoid performance obligations. Any attempt to use repeated or 
frivolous objections to avoid shipping shall itself constitute a material breach entitling 
the Customer to all remedies under Article VIII.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
──────────────────────
ARTICLE VI – REMEDIES AND DAMAGES
Section 6.1 – Reserved Rights. Upon wrongful termination or material breach by the Supplier, the 
Customer reserves all rights under German law, including:
(a)Cover purchase costs (Deckungskauf) under § 281 Abs. 4 BGB;
(b)Additional shipping costs from alternative suppliers;
(c)Consequential damages under § 280 BGB.
Section 6.2 – Regulatory Action. The Customer reserves the right to file complaints with 
Verbraucherzentrale, ASAE, Livro de Reclamações, EU ODR Platform, and other authorities.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
──────────────────────
ARTICLE VII – SETTLEMENT AND CONDITIONAL ABEYANCE OF CLAIMS
Section 7.1 – Settlement of Prior Transaction. The Customer, who explicitly and repeatedly rejected  
the unilateral refund issued by the Supplier on 20 January 2026 and demanded specific performance  
of Order #16045, now accepts said refund as part of this comprehensive settlement agreement  
solely in exchange for the permanent reinstatement of the weekly subscription on the terms set forth  
herein. This acceptance is strictly limited to the financial settlement of Order #16045 and does not  
constitute an admission that the Supplier’s conduct was lawful, nor does it constitute a waiver of the  
Customer’s position that the Supplier’s unilateral cancellation, delay, and refusal to perform  
constituted material breach of contract. This settlement does not waive any rights arising from the  
reinstated subscription or future performance under this Agreement.
Section 7.2 – Conditional Abeyance of Regulatory Proceedings. Regarding the regulatory  
complaints (including but not limited to ASAE and Verbraucherzentrale filings) concerning the  
Supplier's pricing practices, the Customer agrees to hold such filings in abeyance (suspended). This  
suspension is strictly conditioned upon the Supplier's continued compliance with the Fixed Term  
and Pricing obligations set forth in Articles II and III of this Agreement.
Section 7.3 – Revival of Rights upon Material Breach. The suspension of proceedings described in  
Section 7.2 shall automatically terminate, and the Customer's rights to pursue all available  
regulatory and legal remedies shall immediately revive, in the event that the Supplier:
(a) Terminates or suspends supply prior to January 22, 2027 (except for valid good cause pursuant  
to Section 3.4);
(b) Fails to apply the agreed ten percent (10%) Recurring Customer Discount; or
(c) Imposes unauthorized shipping charges.
5 / 6\nIn such event, the Customer reserves the right to claim damages, including the costs of cover  
purchases (Deckungskauf) for the remainder of the Fixed Term.
Section 7.4 – No Admission of Liability. This Article reflects a commercial settlement and does not  
constitute an admission of liability by either party regarding the prior dispute.
Section 7.5 – Preservation of Prior Rights. The expiry or termination of this Agreement, including  
upon completion of the Fixed Term, shall not affect any rights or remedies arising from material  
breaches occurring prior to such expiry or termination, which remain governed by applicable law.
ARTICLE VIII – GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 8.1 – Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of 
Germany.
Section 8.2 – Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding regarding the 
subject matter and supersedes prior negotiations and agreements.
Section 8.3 – Severability. Invalid provisions shall not affect the remaining provisions.
Section 8.4 – Amendments. Amendments require mutual written agreement.
Section 8.5 – Notices. All notices shall be in writing by electronic mail to the addresses specified 
herein.

with head oﬃce at Parque Industrial Armés, Bloco 3, Armazém S - Armés, 2715-771 Terrugem-Sintra,
hereinafter MADE IN MARKET®, is the exclusive owner of all content and information on this website and
the trading company responsible for the billing and supply of products purchased through the same. 
The purchase of products in the online store of the MADE IN
MARKET® website, www.madeinmarket.eu presupposes acceptance of these terms and conditions.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to freely modify the terms and conditions contained herein, within
the scope of applicable law, without prior notice.
Object
1. These terms and conditions are intended to regulate the provision of services of the online store MADE
IN MARKET®.
2. The purchase of any product through the online store implies acceptance of these terms and conditions.
3. Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration. 
Product and Price Information
1. MADE IN MARKET® takes into account the information on the essential characteristics of the products;
however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
2. MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any diﬀerences and/or changes concerning the information
on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents
that accompany the product before use or consumption.
3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
4 / 10\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.
7. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is
announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment
1. To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be
purchased should be added to the "shopping cart". To ﬁnalize the purchase and check out, it is
necessary to conﬁrm the order and provide information regarding the means of payment, shipping
method, and billing
2. Orders placed in the online store will only be processed after payment has been received.
3. Accepted payment methods are VISA®, MasterCard®, Discover®, American Express®, Paypal®, iDeal,
MBWAY, Bank Transfer (ATM), Google Pay® or Apple Pay®, Amazon Pay®, and Made in Market® Gift
Card. Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc.,
Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
4. To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift
card details online after selecting this payment method.
5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds
the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order
contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the
customer).
5 / 10\nShipping Costs

may be subject to additional shipping charges. This primarily applies to orders eligible for free shipping but exceeding the maximum weight

informed by MADE IN MARKET® about the applicable extra shipping fee after placing the order, along with a request for payment of the
additional charge. Some products, such as mineral water or milk, have purchase quantity restrictions.

with information that allows the tracking of the order and thus organizes the delivery with some
accuracy.

incur any costs when returning the goods. The value of damaged products will be refunded after

delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery oﬀered by us), without undue delay and no later
than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless
expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees because of this repayment. We

3. Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration.

2. MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any diﬀerences and/or changes concerning the information
on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents
that accompany the product before use or consumption.
3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
4 / 10\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
6. Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in
force.

announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices
indicated at the time of purchase.
8. The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order conﬁrmation, is an estimated price,
since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
10. Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
11. When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary
depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
12. Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or
wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.

5. For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase,
a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds

than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless

3. MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and
commercial oﬀers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
4 / 10\n4. The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is
collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will
not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which
may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of
the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
5. MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore,
whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or
family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.

since price diﬀerences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are
unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the ﬁnal price be presented.
9. For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT
and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result
in penalties, ﬁnes, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and
cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware
of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and
making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs
associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.

MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modiﬁcations related to the
information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on
product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for
use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.

depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.

wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis.
Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject
to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of ﬁnalizing the order, it will not be
invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be oﬀered in its place.
13. The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.

a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with
an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds

8 / 10\nRefund policy
We have a 14-day return policy, which means you have 14 days after receiving your item to request a
return.
To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, with tags, and
in its original packaging. You’ll also need a receipt or proof of purchase.
To start a return, you can contact us. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and
where to send your package. Items sent back to us without ﬁrst requesting a return will not be
accepted.
You can always contact us for any return questions via email, phone, or chat.
Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on gift cards.
In case of dissatisfaction with a particular product, the customer may always exercise the right to free
termination of the contract upon receipt of the order, not being required to indicate the reason for return,
and simply proceed with the same with the courier who is making the delivery. The amount paid for the
returned product will be refunded later, according to the payment method chosen for the order.
The right to free contract resolution can also be exercised by phone +351 210508653 or by mail
at info@madeinmarket.eu, in which case the products must be returned within 14 days from the date
of reclamation, as long as they are in the same condition in which they were purchased, i.e., with complete
packaging and, if applicable, with manuals, parts, and accessories. The cancellation period will expire after
14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you
acquires, physical possession of the last good. The customer is responsible for any depreciation produced by
any kind of manipulation other than those needed to establish the product’s nature, characteristics, and
correct functioning. The amount paid for the returned product will be refunded, according to the payment
method selected for the order, upon receipt of the product.

too.
Cancellation policy
Consumers have a fourteen-day right to withdraw.
Right of withdrawal
You have the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason. The withdrawal
period is fourteen days from the day on which you or a third party named by you, who is not the carrier, have
taken or have taken possession of the last goods.
To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must contact us (Impeccable Place: Warehouse & Distributions LDA,
Parque Industrial Armés Bloco 3, Armazém S, 2715-771 Sintra, Lisboa, Portugal, info@madeinmarket.eu,
telephone: +351 210 508 653) by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post or an e-mail) of your
decision to revoke this contract. For this purpose, you may use the enclosed sample revocation form, which
is not mandatory.
To comply with the withdrawal period, it is suﬃcient that you send notiﬁcation of the exercise of the right of
9 / 10\nwithdrawal before the expiration of the withdrawal period.
Consequences of the revocation
If you revoke this contract, we shall reimburse you for all payments we have received from you, including
delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of
delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery oﬀered by us), without undue delay and no later
than fourteen days from the day on which we received the notiﬁcation of your revocation of this contract. For
this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless
expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees because of this repayment. We
may refuse repayment until we have received the goods back or until you have provided proof that you have
returned the goods, whichever is earlier.
You must return or hand over the goods to us or to Made In Portugal & Brasil e.K. (Karl-Theodorstrasse 18A,
80803 Munich, Germany) without undue delay and, in any case, no later than fourteen days from the day on
which you notify us of the revocation of this contract. The deadline is met if you send the goods before the
expiration of the fourteen-day period. You shall bear the direct costs of returning the goods. You will only
have to pay for any loss in value of the goods if this loss in value is due to handling of the goods that is not
necessary for checking the condition, properties, and functioning of the goods.
The right of withdrawal does not apply to the following contracts:
Contracts for the delivery of goods that can spoil quickly or whose expiration date would be quickly
exceeded.
Contracts for the delivery of sealed goods that are not suitable for return for reasons of health
protection or hygiene if their seal has been removed after delivery.
Contracts for the delivery of alcoholic beverages, the price of which was agreed upon at the time of the
conclusion of the contract but which can be delivered at the earliest 30 days after the conclusion of the
contract, and the current value of which depends on ﬂuctuations in the market over which the
entrepreneur has no inﬂuence.

Special notes

agreement, provided that both contracts form an economic unit. This is to be assumed, in particular, if we
are your lender at the same time or if your lender makes use of our cooperation with regard to the ﬁnancing.

contract is the acquisition of ﬁnancial instruments (e.g., securities, foreign exchange, or derivatives).
If you want to avoid a contractual obligation as far as possible, make use of your right of revocation and
revoke the loan agreement if you are also entitled to a right of revocation.
