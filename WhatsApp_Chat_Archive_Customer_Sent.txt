16/01/2026, 12:50 - ÷×: Hi MediaMarkt Support,
I am writing this to hopefully resolve the shipping fee issue on my current order of 246 Liters without further friction. After our multiple discussions, I feel it is important to lay out why the current demands are fundamentally unfair and why I am requiring a restoration of my original terms.
Regarding this order, there are key factors that I need you to consider:

1.  *ACCOUNT HISTORY & PRECEDENT:* My purchase history shows that my weekly 70L recurring orders were delayed multiple times, which your system subsequently consolidated into a single 180L shipment. This proves that fulfilling large orders under my free shipping terms is a standard procedure that your logistics team has handled before. The transition to this 246L order was prompted by these delivery inconsistencies, not a change in my needs.

2.  *LEGAL BREACH ON ADVERTISED TERMS:* Your platform explicitly advertises "Free Shipping" for orders over a certain threshold, and my account has a "10% Recurring Benefit." Conditioning the delivery of my order on the removal of this 10% discount to offset shipping costs is a violation of *§ 5 UWG (Bait Advertising) and Decree-Law 57/2008* *. I paid €473.85 on Jan 16—covering the full price of 243L—only to have the order "updated" later that same day with an additional €145 surcharge. Under *§ 312a para. 3 BGB and DL 24/2014*, such unilateral post-checkout surcharges require express consent and are otherwise legally void.

3.  *UNRESOLVED MATERIAL BREACHES & GOOD FAITH:* I want to be very clear: I have acted with extreme patience despite MediaMarkt's prior performance failures. Cartons missing, rotten milk, and items contaminated with black sticky substances constitute material breaches of contract under *§ 433 BGB* *. I have a full dossier ready regarding these unresolved damage claims and the current fee manipulation. However, I am currently *holding back* these formal filings because I would sincerely prefer to move forward as a loyal customer today rather than an adversary. To be met with new surcharges after I overlooked your prior failures is a response that amounted to a slap in the face

4.  *RELIANCE ON PERFORMANCE:* I must clarify that I have relied on this specific shipment for my inventory planning after your repeated 70L delays. A unilateral cancellation or "refund" would not resolve this; it would only amplify the damage by leaving me without supply. I am asserting my right to **Specific Performance**—the delivery of the goods as promised—rather than a return to the status quo. 

5.  *LOGISTICAL NECESSITY (The 246L Calculation):* I carefully calculated my available storage space, and *246 Liters is exactly the maximum capacity I have.* This is not an arbitrary number; it is a logistical necessity for my planning. I have already cleared my schedule and prepared my intake area specifically for this bulk delivery.

*My Goal:*
I honestly do not want to escalate this to a full legal dispute. I have prepared the formal dossiers for *ASAE*, the *Livro de Reclamações*, and the *Verbraucherzentrale* regarding the *§ 312a BGB* violations and the unresolved damage claims, but *I have not submitted them yet.* I am holding back a full escalation because I value our long-term relationship. I would much rather solve this professionally today and move on to a new, low-friction ordering schedule.

*My Proposal:*
Since I have already paid the full amount "under protest" to ensure my supply line isn't interrupted, I require you to:
1.  *Correct the Pricing Discrepancy:* My paid amount of €473.85 should have been more than enough to cover the 246L subtotal (€431.73 with 10% discount). I require the remaining balance of €150.85 (which includes the €145 shipping fee and the item difference) to be waived immediately.
2.  *Process the Overpayment:* The difference between my payment (€473.85) and the discounted subtotal (€431.73), which is **€42.12**, should be credited back to my account or applied to the order.
3.  *Waive the €145 Fee:* Ensure no shipping charges are applied to this 246L shipment, honoring your advertised offer.
4.  *Collaborative Future Terms:* I am prepared to move from weekly 70L deliveries to a consolidated schedule (Monthly 200L+) to significantly reduce your logistical overhead, provided my 10% discount and free shipping status are formally preserved.

Once this is sorted, I am ready to finalize this new consolidated schedule to ensure a sustainable and low-friction partnership for both of us.

Please help me solve this quickly so we can continue on good terms.

Best regards,

Object

The purchase of any product through the online store implies acceptance of these terms and conditions.
Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration. 
Product and Price Information

MADE IN MARKET® takes into account the information on the essential characteristics of the products; however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any differences and/or changes concerning the information on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products. Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents that accompany the product before use or consumption.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and commercial offers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore, whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in force.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices indicated at the time of purchase.
The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order confirmation, is an estimated price, since price differences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the final price be presented.
For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result in penalties, fines, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modifications related to the information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis. Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of finalizing the order, it will not be invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be offered in its place.
The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment

To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be purchased should be added to the "shopping cart".

Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc., Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift card details online after selecting this payment method.
For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase, a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the customer).

The purchase of any product through the online store implies acceptance of these terms and conditions.
Access to the online store does not require any prior subscription or user registration. 
Product and Price Information

MADE IN MARKET® takes into account the information on the essential characteristics of the products; however, these are subject to constant changes about which the customer should be informed.
MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any differences and/or changes concerning the information on the products present in the online store that is provided by the supplier or manufacturer of products. Therefore, it is recommended to read the information on product labels, packaging, and documents that accompany the product before use or consumption.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change, at any time and without notice, the information and commercial offers, including prices, promotions, and trading conditions, presented on its products.
The sale of products in the online store is dependent on the existing stock at the time the product is collected. In case of the unavailability of the product at the time of checkout, the missing products will not be invoiced, and another similar product will be suggested to replace the selected product, which may or may not be accepted by the consumer. In cases of substitution, the price invoiced will be that of the substitute product and not that of the replaced product.
MADE IN MARKET® is a retailer that sells its products directly to the end consumer. Therefore, whenever there are indications that the products being purchased are not intended for personal or family consumption, MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to refuse the sale.
Under the legislation in force, retail prices are presented in € (euros) and include VAT at the legal rate in force.
MADE IN MARKET® reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price is valid for the day it is announced, unless otherwise stated, and MADE IN MARKET® undertakes to apply the rates and prices indicated at the time of purchase.
The total price of the order, which is displayed at the time of order confirmation, is an estimated price, since price differences may arise in eventual products to be substituted or products that are unavailable. Only when the order is delivered will the invoice with the final price be presented.
For all sales outside of the European Union, the customer is responsible for paying any applicable VAT and customs duties. These fees must be paid to the relevant authorities, and failure to do so may result in penalties, fines, and legal consequences. MADE IN MARKET® has no control over these fees and cannot predict the exact amount that will be charged. It is the responsibility of the recipient to be aware of their legal obligations and to ensure that all necessary fees are paid. By using our website and making a purchase, you agree to comply with all relevant laws and regulations and to bear any costs associated with the purchase and importation of goods outside of the European Union.
Food products are subject to constant changes, of which the consumer should always be informed, and MADE IN MARKET® is not responsible for any divergences and/or modifications related to the information on them. Therefore, we recommend that you read carefully the information provided on product labels or tags, namely nutritional information, a list of ingredients, and recommendations for use, preparation, and/or conservation, before using or consuming them.
When purchasing wines and other wine cellar products, we warn that the harvest year may vary depending on the stock of the supply shop, so the year visualized in the image may not correspond.
Promotional sets and packages, which may include complimentary items such as glasses, scarves, or wines, MADE IN MARKET® notes that these items are produced on a seasonal and limited basis. Consequently, based on the stock available at the time of product collection, these items may be subject to substitution. Should a particular item be unavailable at the time of finalizing the order, it will not be invoiced, and an equivalent or better product may be offered in its place.
The images are illustrative, as variations may occur, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Ordering and Payment

To purchase products, users must follow the instructions contained on the website. The products to be purchased should be added to the "shopping cart".

Payments can be processed through the payment integration of Shopify Payments, Stripe Inc., Paybyrd B.V., or Klarna Inc.
To make the payment through the Made in Market® Gift Card, the customer will need to enter the gift card details online after selecting this payment method.
For payments made through Paypal®, MBWAY, and Credit Card, to the estimated value of the purchase, a request is made to the customer's bank to authorize and reserve the total amount of the order with an additional 3%. This amount will be held captive and will be charged only if the order value exceeds the estimated value in the request. The estimated value of the purchase may vary because the order contains items of variable price (by weight) or substitute products (previously approved by the customer).
