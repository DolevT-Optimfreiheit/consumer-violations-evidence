        "desc": "Approximately two weeks after the consumer's last written communication (Binding Confirmation, 22 Jan 2026), the merchant moved the surcharge clause (Item 12 – additional shipping charges for heavy/bulky items, 'informed after placing order') back down to the bottom of the shipping policy at madeinmarket.eu/policies/shipping-policy. The clause had been moved to a more visible position following the consumer's Default Notice (20 Jan 2026); the reversion to the bottom of the page indicates the earlier change was temporary and the practice of placing the clause in minimal prominence has resumed. Item 12 remains a 'surprising clause' under § 305c BGB and does not cure the Button Solution violation (§ 312j BGB); post-payment surcharges remain legally void.",
